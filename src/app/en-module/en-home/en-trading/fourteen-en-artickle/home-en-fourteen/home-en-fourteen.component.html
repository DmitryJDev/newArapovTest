                    </h1>
                    <p><span class="orange">Leverage</span> is a type of credit provided by a broker against the
                        collateral of funds deposited into a trading account.
                        This credit can only be used for buying and selling currency and allows transactions in amounts
                        exceeding one's own
                        funds. Nowadays, leverage sizes range from 1:1 (one to one) to 1:500 (one to five hundred). The
                        number following the
                        colon indicates how many times the broker's credit funds can exceed one's own funds (deposit)
                        during trading
                        operations. Thus, with a deposit of $1000 and leverage of 1:200, one can operate an amount of
                        $200,000, and with
                        leverage of 1:500 — an amount of $500,000. However, this also increases the risk of losing the
                        deposit completely.
                        For example, with a deposit of $2000 and leverage of 1:200, one can buy or sell one standard
                        lot.</p>
                    <p>Economic policy is determined by the interests of industrial and financial groups, exporters and
                        importers of goods
                        and capital, etc. Moreover, considering the increasing interdependence of countries worldwide,
                        optimal economic
                        policy represents a compromise between national and foreign interests.</p>
                    <p>The main economic factors that significantly influence currency exchange rate dynamics are
                        economic indicators,
                        negotiations, meetings of central banks, economic and trade unions, speeches by leaders of major
                        financial and
                        economic state institutions, specialists in economics and financial operations, and agreements
                        on joint
                        interventions.</p>
                    <ul><span class="orange">Economic indicators are important in three aspects:</span>
                        <li>— expected level</li>
                        <li>— previous level</li>
                        <li>— forecast range</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Additionally, the behavior of other markets should be considered: the stock market, gold market,
                        oil market, and
                        agricultural commodities market. If the central bank replenishes reserves by purchasing
                        securities for resale, the
                        discount rate will decrease, allowing banks to lower interest rates and causing the currency
                        rate to fall.
                        Conversely, reducing the country's reserves by selling securities for future buyback leads to an
                        increase in the
                        discount rate, making loans more expensive and enhancing interest in savings in national
                        currency, strengthening it.
                    </p>
                    <p>In case of rising oil prices, for oil-importing countries, an increase in demand for the US
                        dollar can be expected,
                        leading to its appreciation. Lower gold prices increase the acquisition of securities, leading
                        to their appreciation
                        and, consequently, strengthening the national currency. Similarly, cheaper gold raises interest
                        in deposits,
                        allowing banks to control interest rate growth and increase demand for the national currency.
                    </p>
                    <p>For a more accurate assessment of the impact of a particular indicator on currency exchange rate
                        dynamics, it is
                        necessary to consider recent changes, specialists' forecasts, and the correlation of various
                        indicators. It is often
                        the specialists' forecasts that provoke the market's reflective reaction, which, upon data
                        announcement, either
                        intensifies (if the forecast is confirmed) or reverses (if the forecasts are incorrect).</p>
