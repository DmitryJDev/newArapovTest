                    </h1>



                    <p>To earn money in the Forex market, you need to understand the following: to make money on buying
                        and subsequently
                        selling any currency, you buy it at a lower price and sell it at a higher price, earning on the
                        difference between
                        these prices.</p>
                    <p>For example, if you buy 15,000 pesos from a bank for 1,000 dollars, and then when the exchange
                        rate rises to 29,000,
                        you sell them, your profit will be 14,000 pesos.</p>
                    <p>However, many people face two problems.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>such transactions require a significant amount of
                            money</li>
                        <li>waiting for the exchange rate to change can take a lot of time</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>In the Forex market, the situation is different. </p>

                    <p>
                        <span class="orange">First</span>, you can carry out trading operations on
                        amounts that exceed
                        your own funds by 100-200 times, using leverage of 1:100 or 1:200, respectively. In other words,
                        by funding an
                        account with 100 dollars, you can trade with an amount of 10,000-20,000 dollars.
                    </p>
                    <p>Where does this money come from? The broker provides it for currency purchase (of course, not for
                        free, they keep the
                        spread from each trading operation).</p>
                    <p><span class="orange">Second</span>, exchange rates in the Forex market are constantly changing
                        under the influence of
                        millions of transactions
                        carried out by banks, corporations, private investors, and other market participants every
                        minute.</p>
                    <p><span class="orange">Third</span>, in Forex, you do not have to wait for a significant change in
                        the exchange rate. You can
                        earn even on small
                        price fluctuations of 10-20 pips (0.001-0.002 units). For example, by buying 10,000 euros (0.1
                        lot) at a price of
                        1.2745 and selling them at a price of 1.2765 in 20 minutes, you can earn 20 dollars.</p>
                    <p>If you invest 1,000 dollars and buy 100,000 euros, then under the same conditions, you will earn
                        200 dollars. This is
                        a profit, despite the fact that the price changed by only 20 pips (0.002 units) in just 20
                        minutes. Daily price
                        fluctuations in Forex can reach up to 200 pips and even more.</p>
                    <p>Of course, you can also earn money by selling currency. In this case, you do not need to buy the
                        currency first; you
                        simply open a sell position, and the bank automatically sells the currency from its reserves.
                        Then, when the
                        exchange rate drops, you close the position, and the difference between the sale and purchase
                        will be your profit.
                    </p>
                    <p>In general, to earn money in Forex, you need to buy, expecting the exchange rate to rise, and
                        sell, expecting it to
                        fall. If your assumptions are correct and the currency price changes accordingly, you can earn
                        on the difference in
                        currency price.</p>
