                    <h3 class="orange">Each regional FOREX market has its own characteristics. Asian market - FOREX
                        trading hours</h3>
                    <p>During this trading session, the most active transactions are in the exchange operations market
                        of the US dollar to
                        the yen (USD/JPY), the euro to the yen (EUR/JPY), the euro to the dollar (EUR/USD), and the
                        Australian dollar to the
                        US dollar (AUD/USD).</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">European market - FOREX trading hours</h3>
                    <p>The trading session schedule in Europe is quite different from the Asian sessions due to time
                        zone differences.
                        Frankfurt opens at 8:00 Central European Time, and London at 9:00. At this time, trading takes
                        place in European
                        financial centers. The volatility of the most popular currency pairs increases significantly
                        after the start of the
                        FOREX trading session on the London market. Trading activity decreases somewhat by lunchtime,
                        but in the evening,
                        traders are again actively trading. Changes in exchange rates during the European trading
                        session can be
                        substantial, as the bulk of financial assets are concentrated in Europe.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">American market - FOREX trading hours</h3>
                    <p>The most active operations on FOREX begin with the opening of the New York session. At this time,
                        Forex trading
                        begins for US banks, and European dealers return from lunch breaks. The influence of European
                        and American banks is
                        approximately equal, so no significant changes compared to the European trading session occur on
                        Forex. However,
                        after the European market closes, volatility may increase. This is often observed on Friday
                        evenings before the
                        weekend. The American session is more aggressive in trading than others.</p>
