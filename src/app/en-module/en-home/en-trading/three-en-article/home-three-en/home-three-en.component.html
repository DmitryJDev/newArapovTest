                    <h3 class="orange">Exchange</h3>
                    <p>А legal entity that ensures the regular functioning of an organized market for exchange goods,
                        currencies,
                        securities, and derivative financial instruments. Trading is conducted with standard contracts
                        or lots, the sizes of
                        which are regulated by exchange regulatory documents.</p>
                    <p>Before the computerization era, transactions were mostly arranged orally. Now, trading largely
                        takes place
                        electronically using specialized programs, and many exchanges have abandoned trading floors.
                        Brokers, in their own
                        interests or in the interests of clients, enter orders to buy or sell exchange goods into
                        trading systems. These
                        orders are matched with counter orders from other traders. The exchange keeps track of executed
                        transactions,
                        organizes and guarantees settlements (clearing), and provides a mechanism for "delivery versus
                        payment" interaction.
                    </p>
                    <p>Usually, exchanges charge a commission fee for each transaction executed through their
                        assistance, which is their
                        main source of income. Other sources may include membership fees, fees for access to trading,
                        and the sale of
                        exchange information.</p>

                        <li>Commodity exchanges</li>
                        <li>Stock exchanges</li>

                    <h3 class="orange">Commodity Exchange:</h3>
                    <p>On a commodity exchange, there is always an opportunity to buy or sell real goods, despite the
                        fact that modern
                        exchanges primarily represent futures and options markets. Futures are contracts for the
                        delivery of real goods.</p>
                    <h3 class="orange">Stock Exchange:</h3>
                    <p>A stock exchange is a financial institution that ensures the regular functioning of an organized
                        market for
                        securities. In each market economy country, there is a national stock exchange where trading in
                        stocks, bonds, and
                        other financial instruments takes place.</p>
                    <h3 class="orange">Currency Exchange:</h3>
                    <p>A currency exchange is a platform for the free buying and selling of national currencies at
                        established rates, which
                        are formed by supply and demand in the market.</p>
                    <h3 class="orange">Futures Exchange:</h3>
                    <p>A futures exchange (or derivatives exchange) specializes in trading futures contracts —
                        agreements for the future
                        delivery of exchange goods or securities.</p>
                    <p>These types of exchanges perform important functions in financial markets, ensuring liquidity,
                        protecting the
                        interests of market participants, and facilitating efficient price formation.</p>
