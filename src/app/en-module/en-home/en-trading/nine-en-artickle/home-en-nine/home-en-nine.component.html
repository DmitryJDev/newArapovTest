                    </h1>


                    <p>The exchange rate of each currency, due to the globalization of world financial markets, is
                        practically uniform
                        across the globe at any given moment and is formed based on current quotations offered by the
                        largest market
                        participants. The gradual change in the currency exchange rate is related to the fact that these
                        major participants,
                        based on market factors or their interests, begin to raise or lower the quotation. The main
                        factors contributing to
                        the movement of the exchange rate may include:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Changes in economic indicators of the country's economy;</li>
                        <li>Important political events in the world;</li>
                        <li>Major buy-sell transactions by individual market participants;</li>
                        <li>Significant events in related markets (stock, oil, etc.);</li>
                        <li>Changes in the analytical assessment of the currency rate by the majority of participants;
                        </li>
                        <li>Market rumors and changes in market psychology.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Sometimes, certain events cause sharp jumps in the exchange rate, during which prices can
                        fluctuate within a fairly
                        wide range. Such events do not occur often, and the exchange rate changes usually last for a
                        short period.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">Margin Trading</h3>
                    <p>Margin trading refers to transactions in the foreign exchange market carried out by allocating a
                        guaranteed deposit
                        from the client's funds (margin) and the leverage provided by the dealer. The essence of it is
                        that the client, by
                        depositing a certain minimum amount, gets the opportunity to operate with amounts significantly
                        exceeding their own
                        funds. This opportunity is provided by brokerage companies, which, in addition to providing
                        market and trading
                        information services, also provide credit lines â€” significant amounts sufficient to enter the
                        market, with which the
                        investor can freely operate by depositing a certain collateral. The system of providing credit
                        against a fixed
                        collateral amount is called leverage, and the fixed collateral amount itself is called margin.
                        This system of
                        entering the global foreign exchange market is called margin trading.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">Margin</h3>
                    <p>Margin is the amount of guaranteed collateral under which leverage is provided.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">Leverage</h3>
                    <p>Leverage is a system of providing credit against a collateral amount for operations in the
                        international foreign
                        exchange market. Leverage is set by the market-making bank and effectively determines the ratio
                        between the
                        collateral amount and the allocated loan capital.</p>
