                    <p>The change in the exchange rate on the FOREX market is the basis for making a profit since a
                        trader earns only when
                        there is a price movement up or down. However, the change in the currency exchange rate is also
                        the main risk that
                        can lead to losing all the funds invested in trading. The exchange rate on the FOREX market is
                        highly volatile and
                        can be influenced by hundreds of different factors, and predicting their impact is not always
                        possible. In fact, it
                        is absolutely impossible to predict the impact of all factors.</p>
                    <p>Despite the volatility of currency movements, protective orders (such as stop-loss) can
                        significantly reduce the
                        risks associated with sudden changes in the direction of currency movements. These orders are
                        designed to limit
                        losses if the forecast does not materialize and the price starts moving sharply in the opposite
                        direction. The risk
