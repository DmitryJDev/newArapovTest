                    </h1>


                    <p>Another important risk associated with trading on the FOREX currency market is psychological
                        factors related to human
                        emotions, hopes, and experiences. When trading on FOREX, every person experiences a multitude of
                        emotions, with the
                        most dangerous being fear and greed. It is the fear of failure and losing money that causes many
                        to hold on to
                        losing positions, hoping that the price movement will change and they can close the position at
                        a profit. Instead of
                        losing a little and preserving their deposit, many wait for changes, increasing their losses.
                        The higher the losses,
                        the harder it is to acknowledge and accept them, which can result in losing the entire deposit.
                    </p>
                    <p><span class="orange">Greed </span>is no less dangerous on FOREX than fear. Greed drives a person
                        to make impulsive decisions:
                        opening positions
                        irrationally, fearing to miss the opportunity to make a quick profit. After an unsuccessful
                        trade, greed compels
                        trading even more, in hopes of quickly recouping losses, which inevitably leads to new mistakes
                        and so on. In other
                        words, trading under the influence of emotions sooner or later leads to losing all the money.
                    </p>
                    <p>You can fight psychological risks by remaining cool-headed in any situation, guided by reason
                        rather than emotions
                        when making trades. Only use money for trading on the currency market that you can afford to
                        spend without severe
                        consequences; never trade with borrowed or credit funds. A prepared trading plan and strict
                        adherence to it will
                        help avoid many risks. Always use protective orders. Remember that super profits are directly
                        linked to super risks;
                        the main goal is <span class="orange">stability</span>.</p>
