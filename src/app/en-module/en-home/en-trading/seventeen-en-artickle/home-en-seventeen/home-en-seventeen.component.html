                    </h1>


                    <p>Non-market risks of FOREX can include actions by governments or central banks that indirectly
                        affect the currency
                        market, such as administrative barriers or various restrictions. Additionally, natural
                        disasters, terrorist acts,
                        and other indirect impacts on the market can be considered non-market risks. For example, the
                        terrorist attack in
                        New York on September 11, 2001, immediately impacted the currency market: the value of the US
                        dollar sharply fell.
                        Predicting such risks is impossible, but their influence can be limited by protecting positions
                        and constantly
                        monitoring the market situation.</p>
