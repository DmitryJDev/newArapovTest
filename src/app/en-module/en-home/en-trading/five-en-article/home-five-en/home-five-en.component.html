                    <p>Derivative financial instruments traded on exchanges.</p>
                    <h3 class="orange">Derivative Financial Instrument (Derivative)</h3>
                    <p>A financial instrument whose value is based on obligations related to other investment assets or
                        commodities. In
                        simple terms, a derivative is a security based on another security. There are several main types
                        of derivative
                        securities: futures, forward contracts, swaps, options, swaptions, and contracts for
                        differences.</p>
                    <p>Derivatives are categorically divided according to the assets underlying them:</p>
                    <h3 class="orange">Financial Derivative Securities</h3>
                    <p>Contracts based on interest rates for short-term and long-term bonds in the US, UK, and other
                        countries.</p>
                    <h3 class="orange">Currency Derivative Securities</h3>
                    <p>Contracts on the exchange rate of euro/dollar, dollar/yen, and other global currencies.</p>
                    <h3 class="orange">Index Derivative Securities</h3>
                    <p>Contracts on stock indices such as S&P 500, Nasdaq 100, FTSE 100.</p>
                    <h3 class="orange">Commodity Derivative Securities</h3>
                    <p>Contracts for energy resources, such as oil, for precious metals—gold, platinum, palladium,
                        silver—for base
                        metals—aluminum, nickel—and for agricultural products—wheat, soybeans, meat, coffee, cocoa, and
                        even concentrated
                        orange juice.</p>
                    <p>Only a small percentage of transactions (up to 3%) involve actual delivery of the underlying
                        assets of derivative
                        securities. Transactions are primarily settled through mutual cash settlements via the clearing
                        process.</p>
                    <p>Derivative securities serve two main purposes.</p>
                    <p>Firstly, they are used for financial risk hedging. For example, an agricultural producer can
                        protect against future
                        price declines of their produce when planning for harvest. Or an automotive company needing a
                        known quantity of base
                        metal for future production can hedge against its price increase over a specific period.</p>
                    <p>Secondly, derivative securities are among the most profitable instruments for speculative trading
                        operations. For
                        instance, to buy a futures contract for €100,000 against the US dollar with delivery in three
                        months, a deposit of
                        approximately $2,000 is required. This allows leveraging a significant amount of funds
                        essentially for free, known
                        as "trading on margin." Unfortunately, speculative trading with derivative securities is among
                        the riskiest compared
                        to other financial instruments.</p>
